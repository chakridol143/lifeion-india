            <h3>How Water Ionizers Work</h3>
            <p>
              Water Ionizers turn ordinary tap water into ionized, alkaline water by delivering a strong electrical
              current to the water. This process, known as electrolysis, separates the water into two streams: alkaline
              mineral water for drinking and acidic mineral water for the skin, and for cleaning and sanitizing. This
              process also breaks large clusters of water molecules into "micro-clusters"(molecular hydrogen) that are
              readily absorbed by tissues and cells, leading to better hydration at the cellular level.
            </p>
            <p>
